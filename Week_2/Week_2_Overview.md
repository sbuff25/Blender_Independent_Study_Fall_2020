## Week 2
* This week i wanted to model Wordons, it just seems like such an iconic building in Missoula and somthing that would be fun to make a low poly version of.
* I began by gathering reference images of the building and box modeling out the layout for the scene, I originally wanted to include the Old Post building connected to Wordon's however, due to time restrictions I thought it would be best to focus on just one building for now.
* Anyways my overall workflow was pretty strait forward, i just used reference images and modeled what I saw.
* Finally to wrap everything up i used an add on Material pack for the colors and threw an HDRI on the scene to really make everything pop.
* Very satisfied by the outcome and i may just work in this style throughout the semester.
