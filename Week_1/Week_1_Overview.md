## Week 1 Summery

* For the first week I thought I'd start out simple by creating a little nature scene.
* I began by creating the base of the scene by taking a circle and extruding it down and out.
* For the grass all I did was take a sphere, cut it in half and add a particle system across its surface to create a nice layer of grass.
* As for the trees, I started by creating a single vertice and extruded it along the Z axis. I then added more vertices and deformed them along the X and Y axis to create the shape of the tree. After that i used a solidify modifier to give the vertices a mesh. I added a wood material to the mesh and did some sculpting to give the mesh the look and feel of bark. The leaves were created by using a particle system much like the grass. However this time I modeled out multiple variations of the leaves to add more randomness to the particle system and emitted them along the surface of Icospheres that serve as a base for the leaves to hang on to.
* For the fence, I box-modled out the shape of the fence starting with a cube and used an array modifier to distribute the shape around a curve at the base, this method is much easier than individually placing the fence posts and is much faster. I then applied a UV texture to the fence to give it that old whitewashed look.
* Finally I used a variety of lights including a SUN, POINT and AREA lights to give off the ambiance achieved in the final render.
